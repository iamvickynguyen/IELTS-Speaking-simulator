# IELTS-Speaking-simulator
An Android app that helps people practice speaking English for IELTS exam.

I built this when I was in high school and knew a little bit about Android Studio, so this app is super simple, but it still can help me get through IELTS speaking exam, my worst skill. I used Google text to speech.

## Feature
- Detects whether the user is speaking or not, and records their voice. 
- Automatically asks another question if the user stops speaking for a specific amount of time
- User can listen to their recordings and figure out their mistakes

(I highly recommend that you have internet access for accuracy.)

## What is still missing
A delete function, which deletes current audio files stored on the phone.
